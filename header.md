General
=======

All requests to the API must be made using x-www-form-urlencoded format.
To authenticate your request use the header **x-auth-token** on every call.
The api will redirect any request from *http* to *https*. All responses are in JSON.
The only handled errors are 400 for payload not validated and 500 for application erros.
